At present, types of seeds with long roots are being developed to resist drought, as these long roots are able to reach water sources in the ground, which reduces their need for irrigated water, so that the crop can benefit from the water stored in the roots, and this process helps to increase The dry matter content of potatoes, which contributes to accelerating their ripening."),
